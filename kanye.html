    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
        I am Warhol! I am the #1 most impactful artist of our generation! I am
        Shakespeare in the flesh, WALT DISNEY! Nike! GOOGLE!! I am from Chicago, Illinois
        and am 40 years young. I have a wife (Kim Kardashian-West), and 2 kids (North and Saint).
        My fame started as a producer for Roc-A-Fella records, and evolved as I became a
        Grammy-award winning musician with 8 legendary albums. I am a fashion designer, most
        known for my Yeezy season collection - including the rare and sought-after Yeezy sneakers.
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        I like rapping, producing, and fashion. I began as one of the greatest producers
        in history, and people tried to marginalize me when I started trying to get into
        rap. So I became one of the greatest rappers in history. People are now trying
        to marginalize me as I become one of the greatest fashion icons in history.

    <h2>My Favorite Memory</h2>
    <h3>The 2009 VMA's</h3>
    <p>
        One of my favorite memories was the time I interrupted Taylor Swift
        (I let her finish) in her acceptance speech for Female Video of the Year.
        She cried, but I didn't care *Kanye shrug*. Beyonce deserved that award;
        she had the greatest video of all time. <span id="shout">ALL TIME!!</span>
